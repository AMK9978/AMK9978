#First part:
Because of lack of specialty in algorithm design , I want to take this course to improve my skills and use them to find a job in software companies. I'm so hopeful Courseera accept my  demand and help me to get salary.
I invoke you to allow me to improve my skills.
As I showed in my education history, I'm really curios for discovering and if I could maybe I paid for this course but right now I can't and I have no job and I'm job seeker.

#Second part:
Because of unavailability of paying services I can't and also I have no salary to pay and I'm hopeful by using courseera courses finding a job and after that I will think to this.
There is no doubt about that digital marketing is base of every software business, due to this huge importance and my curiosity I wanted to use this course. I want to be an entrepreneur in software.
#Third part:
Right now I have no job, but if I find and I can, I love to support because some other people exist that cannot pay and I want to help humanity.
